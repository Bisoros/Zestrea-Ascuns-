# Zestrea-Ascunsă
The source code of the "Zestrea Ascunsă" project  
"Folklore Archives as Open Source and the Spread of Memory Boxes"  
"An alternative solution to the long term preservation of the documents from the Folklore Archive of the Romanian Academy. This solution can be viewed from several organic perspectives: one of the zoo, one of the seed-bank and, finally, the guerrilla gardening perspective. The first one insists on the importance of returning into the wild what was once captured on the field of research, the second one is about the seed-bank as a live database for future generations and the last one offers a way of adopting the seed bombing method to the problem of disappearing immaterial cultural heritage."
